# python-ioctl ![checks](https://github.com/FFY00/python-ioctl/workflows/checks/badge.svg)

Pure python typed ioctl implementation


### Development

We use [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) to run static checks in scripts, and
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run misc checks. Install the pre-commit
hook with `pre-commit install`.
